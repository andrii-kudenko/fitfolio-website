However, since the xxl hoodie is so comfortable I decided to keep it and I ordered a XL that fits just right. The Jordan brand hoodies are big in size compared to the regular nike hoodies. I use the xxl hoodie to wear around the house and when I go to the gym🤣",

The design of the thick puffy sections is very in right now, making this jacket very stylish.",

They don’t move at all, and the material is super soft and sweat proof (I’m funning with materials and textures and these are by far the best!). Pockets are also a bonus!",

The Playful Pink shade is even more stunning in person — soft, feminine, and eye-catching in the best way. It does run a little small, so I’d recommend going up a size for the perfect fit. Overall, it’s such a beautiful, stylish piece — definitely a must-have!",

I like the 2 tone panels, it gives it a fun style. The pockets have zippers for securing anything that you need to carry and it has a 2 way zipper. Overall very good and worth trying!",
